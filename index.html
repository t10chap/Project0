            <p>
              I am currently a General Assembly Student. I was born and raised in Washington State but currently am residing within California
              while I attend the WDI (Web Development Immersive) bootcamp. I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends, and
              helping others. Although I run into rough patches a lot, especially when it comes to my studies, I love to understand and
              learn new things/ talents.
