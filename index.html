              In here are a list of projects that I have completed throughout my web development career. What's quite entertaining
              about these images, is that you are capable of scrolling through them by either selecting one of the arrows or by
              selecting the dot indexs below the image.

              I am currently a General Assembly Student. I was born and raised in Washington State but currently am residing within California
              while I attend the WDI (Web Development Immersive) bootcamp. I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends, and
              helping others. Although I run into rough patches a lot, especially when it comes to my studies, I love to understand and
              learn new things/ talents.
