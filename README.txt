(Got sick, so here's my Website cut short)

In my website I kept it quite simple and tried to meet the
standard requirements. I had big plans to add in waypoint effects
by determining offset heights. I did my research but wanted to
finish the simple things first.

Technologies Used:

I tried to stay away from JQuery to better my fundamentals without it.
I was told it was not used so much in the real world because it requires
a download which ends up taking memory can slow can a website.
I used google fonts in order to receive my main font throughout my page.
And other Technologies I used were just linking my stylesheet and script.

Approach:

I like to approach my website by starting off by doing as much HTML
as I think I'll need, then I move into styling within my CSS page. After
that is all said and done, I go into my Javascript and make adjustments to
HTML and CSS as needed. In more detail, I basically get setup the layout of
my page, getting all the images, text, colors, and etc in order so when
I get down to adding animations and a more entertaining UI, all I have to do
is add in a few animations.

Unsolved Problems:

1. My timed carousel isn't up and running. I tried to figure out the process
by implementing text into my HTML and assigning them a class to not display.
Then I'd set just one testimonial a class of active in order to display that
block of text. I tried to implement a function within my Javascript to create
a timer and set each value of the timer to my blocks of text. And then overall
change the active class to the current timer's time. This did not work out.

2. I did not get my "contact me" form to output to a document like I wanted.

3. The UI is just sloppy, it's not really appealing.

Biggest Wins and Challenges:

My biggest win was supposed to be the waypoint. That was the feature I
was most interested in and wanted to add to my website. But other than that
my biggest win was my nav bar and carousel images. Those were quite
challenging for different reasons. The side nav bar was challenging because
I didn't try to do a top navigation bar like what we've leaning towards in
class. I went for a unique side nav bar that pushes my page to the side upon
opening. The carousel was a very hard challenge and I had to do a lot of
research and outline following in order to implement that within my code.
And even after I ended up getting it onto my website it broke it. For awhile I
couldn't figure out what was wrong until I stumbled across a div tag that was
closing "mainBox" container early and throwing off my entire layout.
